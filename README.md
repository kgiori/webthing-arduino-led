# webthing-arduino-led
Specific example using PlatformIO to build a web thing controllable LED on an MCU board.

This repo is intended to reduce the complexity for developers who want to build simple web things. Using the webthing-arduino library, this example lets a developer build and test a specific "web thing LED" example. It is a simple first test, much like the usefulness of the Arduino sketch "Blink.ino". It lets you know your setup is working before you try something more complex. 

Using this example, if a supported MCU board successfully connects to a Mozilla Things Gateway, then the onboard LED can be turned on and off using the Things Gateway GUI. (See https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway for more info on the gateway.)
